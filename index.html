Learning new things is very interesting and it motivate me to sit for learning every day.</p>

                <p>The term is very funny to introduce a web developer who has started his job as an intern or trainee web developer. Actually this is a small steps to start a long journey like the proverb "a journey of thousand miles begins with a small step".   </p>
